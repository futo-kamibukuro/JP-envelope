# Japanese Envelopes: Cultural Insights and Templates

Welcome to this repository where I've uploaded unfolded templates of various types of Japanese envelopes. In this README, I will introduce the cultural significance, types, and usage of Japanese envelopes, known as **"futo" (封筒)**, and provide insights into their role in traditional and modern Japanese society.

## Introduction to Japanese Envelopes

In Japan, envelopes are more than just simple containers for letters or documents; they carry cultural significance and are used with specific etiquette. Japanese society places great importance on respect, formality, and attention to detail, all of which are reflected in how envelopes are designed, chosen, and used. From everyday correspondence to ceremonial purposes, Japanese envelopes come in various shapes, designs, and sizes, each suited to specific occasions and uses.

## Historical and Cultural Background

Historically, the Japanese have placed great emphasis on aesthetics and symbolism. This extends to even the smallest of details, including envelopes. In the Edo period (1603-1868), envelopes were often used as a means of formal communication, where the way an envelope was folded, sealed, and presented could convey as much meaning as the content inside. Today, this attention to presentation remains important in both business and personal interactions.

## Types of Japanese Envelopes

Japanese envelopes can be broadly categorized into different types based on their material, design, and purpose. Below are the most common types of Japanese envelopes you will encounter:

### 1. **Shugi-bukuro (祝儀袋)** – For Celebrations
The **shugi-bukuro** is a decorative envelope used to give monetary gifts on special occasions such as weddings, births, and other joyful events. These envelopes are typically adorned with intricate designs, decorative paper, and often tied with a special knot known as a **mizuhiki** (水引). The type of knot used signifies the occasion – for example, a knot that cannot be untied is used for weddings, symbolizing a bond that cannot be broken.

### 2. **Koden-bukuro (香典袋)** – For Funerals
In contrast to the celebratory shugi-bukuro, the **koden-bukuro** is used for giving condolence money at funerals. These envelopes are often more somber in color, featuring white and black or white and silver. The **mizuhiki** on these envelopes is tied in a specific way to indicate mourning.

### 3. **Noshigami (熨斗紙)** – Formal Gifts
**Noshigami** envelopes or wrappers are used for formal gift-giving, often for items rather than money. These are typically used for gifts between businesses or to mark the start of a new year or significant events. The envelope is often plain but adorned with the **noshi**, a decorative strip of paper symbolizing good fortune.

### 4. **Ofukurosashi (おふくろ差し)** – Standard Postal Envelopes
These are the everyday envelopes used for mailing letters or documents. They are generally plain, often featuring a vertical design, with space for the recipient’s and sender’s addresses. While not as decorative as other types, these envelopes still reflect the Japanese attention to neatness and precision, especially in how addresses are written.

### 5. **Tegami-bukuro (手紙袋)** – For Personal Letters
Tegami-bukuro envelopes are used for sending personal letters. They often feature traditional Japanese designs, such as cherry blossoms, cranes, or seasonal patterns. These envelopes are typically smaller than the standard western envelope and are designed to be elegant and understated, emphasizing the sentiment behind the letter.

## Materials and Design

Japanese envelopes are typically made from high-quality paper, with an emphasis on texture and color. Many envelopes feature **washi** (和紙), a traditional Japanese paper known for its durability and unique texture. Washi paper envelopes are often used for formal or ceremonial purposes, where the envelope itself is part of the gift.

**Design Elements**:
- **Mizuhiki**: Decorative cords used on envelopes for formal occasions. The type of mizuhiki and its knot are significant and carry cultural meaning.
- **Washi Paper**: Handcrafted Japanese paper, often used for high-quality, elegant envelopes.
- **Kamon (家紋)**: Family crests or traditional symbols may appear on formal envelopes, particularly those used for weddings and funerals.

## Etiquette Around Using Envelopes

Japan is a country that values etiquette, and this extends to the use of envelopes. When giving money as a gift, for example, it is considered polite to give new, crisp bills inside a properly folded and sealed envelope. Additionally, the envelope’s design should match the formality of the occasion. Writing neatly on the envelope and following the correct folding techniques are essential parts of showing respect to the recipient.

For business or personal letters, Japanese envelopes are typically addressed vertically, and great care is taken to present the envelope in a clean and precise manner. Even the orientation of the stamps and seals can carry meaning in some contexts.

## How to Fold and Seal Japanese Envelopes

For certain types of envelopes, especially ceremonial ones, there is an art to how the envelope is folded and sealed. In many cases, traditional envelopes do not use glue but are folded in such a way that they remain closed through their design. Seals, stickers, or wax may also be used for extra formality.

### Example Folding Techniques
- **Vertical Folding**: Often used for formal or ceremonial envelopes, where the content is folded and placed vertically inside the envelope.
- **Horizontal Folding**: Used for more casual correspondence, where the letter or content is folded in a western style and placed horizontally.
